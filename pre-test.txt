1.)  Microservices are an architectural style that structure applications as a collection of loosely connected services,
     making it easier for developers to build and scale apps. Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale 
     and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.

2.)  Microservices bring multiple benefits:
     - Scalability   
     - Faster development
     - Improved data security
     - Better data governance
     - The opportunity to become language and technology agnostic

3.) Advantages:

     - Scalability
     - Use of containers, allowing for a quick deployment and development of the application
     - Developer freedom to develop and deploy services independently
     - Minimal work team
     - Modular functionality, independent modules.

    Disadvantages:

     - Developer need to solve problems such as network latency or load balancing
     - Complexity of managing a large number of services
     - High memory use     
     - Time required to fragment different microservices
     - Complex testing over the distributed deployment

4.) Back End
    - The time to fetching data jobstreet is faster than glints, this is because the possibility of glints data is greater
      so that there are quite a lot of SQL table joins compared to jobstreet,
    - When i see from the chome tools, Jobstreet Network may still use the MVC concept with PHP language which does not separate the front end and back end, 
      it can be seen from the small number of fetching APIs and there is a dot php extension in the url link. While glints a lot of fetching API services.

     Front End
    - Glints has more features than jobstreet such as a more complete job search filter
    - From pagination glints is better because it only needs scrolling to fetch data on the next page, 
      while jobstreet has to click the page button you want to go to
